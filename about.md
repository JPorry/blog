Hello there!

My name is Javi, I am a 30-year old javascript developer from Madrid (Spain). Even though I spent most of my life in Valencia (Spain), nowadays I am working in Dublin (Ireland).

A lot of people, mostly in job interviews, keep asking me the same question: *Why JavaScript?*. They are really surprised that almost all of my background (it has been more than 8 years coding stuff for the Web) goes around JS. My answer is allways the same, Internet is the biggest thing that happend to the world in the last century, Javascript is Internet's language.  
This has become even more clear over the last four or five years, things like node.js and frameworks like Backbone, Angular or React have changed the game so much.

So yeah, I love JS. That is why I decided to start this blog, it is a thing I always wanted to do but I never found the time for it! It was really about time...

I really hope my posts can help someone to increase their knowledge or at least we can have a nice time together!

Thanks a lot!

Javi.
